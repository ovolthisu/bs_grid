## 1. Place Towers Strategically
 
There are several different towers to choose from when you play this game. That does not mean, however, that you should just plop down whichever tower tickles your fancy. Each tower has its own set of characteristics. You need to place each tower strategically in order to maximize their use[^2^]. For example, the Ninja Monkey and the Tack Shooter both have the ability to hit multiple targets at once. The best place to put them is in corners so that they can wipe out all Bloons in their vicinity[^1^]. Another useful tower is the Ice Tower which slows down enemies as they pass. Make sure you put Ice Towers in high-traffic areas on the track to help manage the flow of enemies[^2^]. Read up on the characteristics of each tower and think about how you can take advantage of them.
 
## 2. Use Different Towers
 
While there will always be favorites when it comes to towers, you should still consider mixing up the towers you place on the track. As mentioned before, each tower has its own characteristics. In the same way, there will be different types of Bloons coming your way. Some of them will require specific towers to defeat[^2^]. For example, there are camouflaged Bloons and you will need Ninja Monkeys to detect them[^1^]. There are also metal-coated Bloons that will be difficult to take out using most towers. You will need to use cannons to break through the armor of coated enemies[^1^]. Always use different types of towers to make sure you are prepared to handle all kinds of enemies.
 
## 3. Claim The Daily Rewards
 
Money can be a challenge in this game, especially if you are still starting out. That is why every little bit of help can go a long way. Make sure you take advantage of the freebies the game gives away in the form of Daily Login Rewards[^3^]. All you need to do is log into the game once a day and claim your reward from the giant treasure box. You can get all sorts of things from the daily rewards, including money, special monkeys, and items[^3^]. The money you earn in the game can be used on specialty houses that can give you different advantages in the game[^1^].
